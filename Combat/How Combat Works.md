Resources:
	When it comes to the turn base system, resources are allocated to each player to use on each of their turns. The two most important are: Action Points and Reaction Points. Every Character starts out with 6 AP and 3 Rp. The six action points can only be used while its your turn while your 3 reaction points can be used at anytime to the extent as an interrupt on someone else's turn. 

Combat Actions and turns:
	>When combat is declared by the GM, a turn order is established first. All players and enemies will roll initiative to see who will go. Once the turn order is established, it will start at whomever go the highest initiative and work its way down. 
	>When its your turn, these are the actions you may take:
		-Attack action: This action will take the amount of AP needed from the weapon you are using into account for its cost. When you attack, you will declare a target(s) within legal limits provided by the weapon. 
		-Cast any spell: This action's cost of AP will be dictated by the spell itself. You will be able to cast any type of spell as long as it's legal (ie: you have enough AP or MP to cast it)
		-Move: This move is a transaction: where 1 AP will provide a player with an amount of movement equal to their speed. They can then use this movement as a way to get around the battlefield. 
		-Use item: This is also determined by the item themself, but as a rule of thumb, anything in your bag costs 3 AP to use or throw. 
		-interact: To interact with the world around you, like opening doors, pulling levers and cutting a rope. This action costs 1 AP
	>When its not your turn, you may do these actions as an interrupts between actions of the one that currently has its turn:
		-Attack action: This action will take the amount of RP needed from the weapon you are using into account for its cost. When you attack, you will declare a target(s) within legal limits provided by the weapon. 
		-Cast certain spells: This action's cost of RP will be dictated by the spell itself. You will be able to cast any type of spell as long as it's legal and if RP is the only resource used.
		-Use item: This is also determined by the item themself, but as a rule of thumb, anything in your bag costs 3 RP to use or throw. 
		-interact: To interact with the world around you, like opening doors, pulling levers and cutting a rope. This action costs 1 RP

Attacking and Damage:
	>With weapons, they come with Attacker's Dice (AD) which determines if an attack hits and how much damage it does. There are modifiers to AD's such as advantage X and how much damage it does on hit. An example of this is: (adv 2) 2D4 For 3, where (adv 2) grants the ability to roll two additional dies (in this case D4s) and pick the highest two out of all 4. The 2D4 is the ADs itself and the for 3 is the damage delt for each dice that makes it through the defenses. More can be added such as a 1D8,  creating the example of: (1D8) + ((adv 2) 2D4 for 3) but this can get complicated fast and is not recommended. 
	>When it comes to damage itself, every weapon will have a fixed amount of damage down when an attack goes through. However, depending on certain criteria, that damage can change. For example, if a max roll goes through, it does extra damage. Or if 2 of the same number goes through, it does extra damage. But any effect like that will be specified and weapon specific. Attack damage can also go up over time and depending on what value the AD was. For example, the damage could be tied directly to your strength modifier, doing damage equal to it. Or if specifically an AD of 2 goes through, it does more damage than if a 3 does.

Blocking/Negating Damage:
	This part has been through a lot of work but this seems to be better than previous versions:
		>The defender will have an evasion score, an armor score and maybe a mitigation score. These scores will determine the Defender's Dice (DD) rolled and the type of dice rolled when attacked. For instants: Someone with an evasion score of 8 and an armor score of 2 will be able to roll 2D8 in response to being attacked. Then they may choose to discard any of the Attacker's Dice that's equal to or below any DD the defender rolled, limiting or possibly negating damage.  

Health:
	The vitality of a Character will be calculated as followed: (Physique + Will)(level). I wonder if I should do levels of exhaustion as life is lost but for now, if the Player reaches zero, he goes into death saving throws.

Rules:
	>When Attacking and defending has been declared this is the turn order: 1 The attacker will roll all dice involved, including any advantage dice. 2 The defender will roll their Defender's Dice and then choose which of the Attackers Dice to negate which will include any dice that's there because of advantage. 3 The attacker will then, especially if more than the required dice amount remain, choose which dice will be used to determine damage. If no dice remain, any and all damage involved in the attack is voided. 
	>When attacking, the AP/RP cost for an attack can not reach below 1. So even though the AP/RP cost to attack may technically be 0, it actually costs 1 AP/RP.

Dual Wielding: 
	You may dual wield if both weapons are one handed and lack the heavy trait. When you attack with one weapon, you may attack with the other weapon afterwards at the same target. It takes one less AP to attack with the second weapon. For example: you attack a goblin with a bastard sword and deal damage to it. Then, only using another 2 AP, you attack with your battle Axe at the same goblin, dealing more damage.
