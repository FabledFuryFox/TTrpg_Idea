Overview:
	This section provides in details as to what and how the adventurer may carry equipment and items. The point of this is to provide a tactical and realistic way of how an adventurer might equip themselves and carry all necessary items. 

Rule Sets for equipment:
	>To take something off of a slot or to put something into a slot, it takes all AP and RP for that turn to do so.
	>You can only have one slot filled at a time unless the equipment states otherwise
	>When it comes to Mandatory slots, anything can go in one as long as it meets the right size attribute or smaller.

Mandatory:
	Back Slot:
		This slot is the only one with the large attribute. Usually the slot is reserved for a heavy weapon or travelers backpack.
	Belt Slots
		The belt contains multiple slots and can be customized. They have:
		>2 medium sized slots, meant for weapon carrying 
		>3 small sized slots, these are functionally the most diversely used slots and are useful to have prepared when in combat. It effectively lessens the amount of AP needed to use an item stored in one of the slots. The reduction is 2 AP to a minimum required 1 AP used. For example, to drink a potion, it usually takes 2 AP to do that while its in your pack, however, if the potion is placed in one of the belt slots, it only takes 1 AP. 


Optional:
	Head Gear:
		This Slot is meant for anything from helmets to circlets. As such, it may also fill other slots so be aware to this fact. 
	Face Gear:
		Usually reserved for things like lenses and Goggles
	Neck Adornments: 
		There are two slots for this and usually include things like necklaces or amulets
	Outer Body Protection:
		Usually meant for armor like a breastplate, However; this may also include things like layered clothing like thin leather armor and a cloak.
	Clothing: 
		Mostly meant as a cosmetic layer of what's worn beneath the armor or outside of combat situations.
	Hands:
		This slot is pretty weird as you have either 2 slots for rings or one slot for something like gloves
