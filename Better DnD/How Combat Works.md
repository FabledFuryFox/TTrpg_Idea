Resources:
	When it comes to the turn base system, resources are allocated to each player to use on each of their turns. The two most important are: Action Points and Reaction Points. Every Character starts out with 6 AP and 3 Rp. The six action points can only be used while its your turn while your 3 reaction points can be used at anytime to the extent as an interrupt on someone else's turn.  

Attacking and Damage:
	With weapons, they come with damage dice (DD) which determines if an attack hits and how much damage it does. There are modifiers to DD's such as advantage X and an increase to the DD. An example of this is: (adv 2) 2D4 + 5, where (adv 2) grants the ability to roll two additional dies (in this case D4s) and pick the highest two out of all 4. The 2D4 is the DDs itself and the + 5 is an increase to the total of the dice roll at max being 13 and the min being 7. More can be added such as adding 1D8 those creating (1D8) + ((adv 2) 2D4 + 5) but this can get complicated fast and is not recommended. 

Blocking/Negating Damage:
	This part isn't completely fleshed out but I'm thinking of 3 possible ways to help lessen damage. 
		> Dice negation or Armor: where if a value is rolled equal to or less than the dice negation, its terminated. This stat will be influenced by the armor an individual will wear and to a lesser extent, their physique stat
		> Scrapping dice or Evasion: where, before DDs are rolled, subtract the amount of dice rolled, this includes advantage rolls as well. So If I roll (adv 2) 1D8 and my opponent has an evasion score of 2 I'd only be able to roll 1D8 in total. This stat will be determined through: Focus, Technical and Finesse traits.
		>  Mitigation: Where the total amount of damage is subtracted by the Mitigation value.  This stat will be determined by the Sense, Wisdom and Will Traits.

Health:
	The vitality of a Character will be calculated as followed: (Physique + Will)(level). I wonder if I should levels of exhaustion as life is lost but for now, if the Player reaches zero, he goes into death saving throws.
