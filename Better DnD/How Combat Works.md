Resources:
	When it comes to the turn base system, resources are allocated to each player to use on each of their turns. The two most important are: Action Points and Reaction Points. Every Character starts out with 6 AP and 3 Rp. The six action points can only be used while its your turn while your 3 reaction points can be used at anytime to the extent as an interrupt on someone else's turn.  

Attacking and Damage:
	>With weapons, they come with Attacker's Dice (AD) which determines if an attack hits and how much damage it does. There are modifiers to AD's such as advantage X and how much damage it does on hit. An example of this is: (adv 2) 2D4 For 3, where (adv 2) grants the ability to roll two additional dies (in this case D4s) and pick the highest two out of all 4. The 2D4 is the ADs itself and the for 3 is the damage delt for each dice that makes it through the defenses. More can be added such as a 1D8,  creating the example of: (1D8) + ((adv 2) 2D4 for 3) but this can get complicated fast and is not recommended. 
	>When it comes to damage itself, every weapon will have a fixed amount of damage down when an attack goes through. However, depending on certain criteria, that damage can change. For example, if a max roll goes through, it does extra damage. Or if 2 of the same number goes through, it does extra damage. But any effect like that will be specified and weapon specific. Attack damage can also go up over time and depending on what value the AD was. For example, the damage could be tied directly to your strength modifier, doing damage equal to it. Or if specifically an AD of 2 goes through, it does more damage than if a 3 does.

Blocking/Negating Damage:
	This part has been through a lot of work but this seems to be better than previous versions:
		>The defender will have an evasion score, an armor score and maybe a mitigation score. These scores will determine the Defender's Dice (DD) rolled and the type of dice rolled when attacked. For instants: Someone with an evasion score of 8 and an armor score of 2 will be able to roll 2D8 in response to being attacked. Then they may choose to discard any of the Attacker's Dice that's equal to or below any DD the defender rolled, limiting or possibly negating damage.  

Health:
	The vitality of a Character will be calculated as followed: (Physique + Will)(level). I wonder if I should levels of exhaustion as life is lost but for now, if the Player reaches zero, he goes into death saving throws.

Rules:
	>When Attacking and defending has been declared this is the turn order: 1 The attacker will roll all dice involved, including any advantage dice. 2 The defender will roll their Defender's Dice and then choose which of the Attackers Dice to negate which will include any dice that's there because of advantage. 3 The attacker will then, especially if more than the required dice amount remain, choose which dice will be used to determine damage. If no dice remain, any and all damage involved in the attack is voided.
